### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
     - Handling missing data: 
     1. 

     - Data normalisation


     
     
     
     
     # Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, interpolation) or removing rows/columns with too many null values.
     - **Outlier detection**: Using statistical techniques like Z-score or IQR to detect and handle extreme values.
     - **Data normalization or scaling**: Ensuring consistent units or scaling numerical data.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Why it’s important**: EDA helps you understand the underlying patterns and structure of your data before diving into deeper analysis.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Descriptive statistics**: Measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of variables.
     - **Correlation analysis**: Checking relationships between variables using heatmaps, scatter plots, or correlation matrices.
     - **Visual tools**: Use of box plots, histograms, and scatterplots to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships.
     - **Real-World Example**: Analyze a sales dataset to uncover patterns, such as which products have the highest average sales, seasonal trends, or customer demographics.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Why it’s important**: Effective communication of findings is crucial, and visualizations help stakeholders grasp complex data insights.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Charts and graphs**: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and other visuals to present insights.
     - **Dashboard design**: Show how you create interactive dashboards to allow stakeholders to explore the data themselves.
     - **Visualization best practices**: Use clear, simple, and accessible visualizations to avoid misleading representations.
     - **Tools**: Demonstrate proficiency in using Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
     - **Real-World Example**: Create an interactive dashboard that tracks key business KPIs, like revenue, customer churn, or product performance over time.

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - **Why it’s important**: Data analysts need to make decisions based on statistical inferences, and understanding core statistical methods is crucial for making data-driven decisions.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Hypothesis testing**: Show how you use techniques like t-tests, chi-square tests, or ANOVA to test assumptions or claims about data.
     - **Correlation and causation**: Differentiate between correlation and causality with tools like Pearson or Spearman correlation tests.
     - **Regression analysis**: Include simple linear regression or multiple regression models to predict outcomes or assess relationships.
     - **Real-World Example**: Use statistical analysis to test a business hypothesis, like whether a marketing campaign significantly increased sales or customer retention.

### 5. **SQL for Data Extraction and Manipulation**
   - **Why it’s important**: SQL is essential for extracting data from databases, which is a key part of the data analysis process.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Basic queries**: Demonstrate SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses to extract specific data subsets.
     - **Advanced queries**: Use subqueries, window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER, RANK), and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex analysis.
     - **Data aggregation**: Calculate sums, averages, or counts, and manipulate datasets to create new variables or segment data.
     - **Real-World Example**: Write SQL queries to extract sales data from a relational database, segment it by product category, and find key performance metrics like total sales or average order value.

### 6. **Data Modeling**
   - **Why it’s important**: Data modeling involves creating frameworks that structure data for easier analysis and reporting.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Relational databases**: Show how you design or work with databases that organize data efficiently using entities and relationships.
     - **Simple predictive models**: Demonstrate your ability to create models (like linear or logistic regression) to predict trends and outcomes based on data.
     - **Data validation**: Ensure that the models you create are properly validated with metrics like R-squared, accuracy, or confusion matrices.
     - **Real-World Example**: Build a simple linear regression model predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) based on historical sales and demographic data.

### 7. **Automation and Scripting**
   - **Why it’s important**: Automating repetitive tasks can save time and ensure consistency in your data analysis process.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Scripts for data cleaning**: Automate data cleaning processes to handle large datasets consistently.
     - **Data pipelines**: Set up workflows to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
     - **Automation of reporting**: Set up recurring reports or dashboard updates with Python or other tools.
     - **Real-World Example**: Use Python scripting to automate the process of cleaning and aggregating weekly sales data, generating an automated report for stakeholders.

### 8. **Real-World Projects**
   - **Why it’s important**: Potential employers want to see that you can apply your skills to real-world datasets and provide valuable business insights.
   - **What to include**:
     - Use open datasets (like from **Kaggle** or government databases) to create analyses that answer specific business questions.
     - Focus on **actionable insights** and how they can drive business decisions.
     - **Real-World Example**: Use an open dataset from the healthcare industry to analyze patient trends, discover factors contributing to hospital readmission rates, and suggest actionable interventions.

### 9. **Storytelling with Data**
   - **Why it’s important**: Storytelling is what separates a good data analyst from a great one. You need to be able to translate data insights into actionable business decisions.
   - **What to include**:
     - **Problem framing**: Start each project with a clear
